    - checking if a primary has been fired

2. firing single torpedo two times, with 1-1 torpedo stores
    - all torpedo stores have at least one torpedo
    - calling firingTorpedo() in single mode
    - calling firingTorpedo() in single mode second time

    - calling fireTorpedo in single mode
    - TorpedoStore.fire reports failure
